The AI engineer successfully initiated the IntownLocal mobile app development, transitioning from a basic concept to a multi-flow application. Initially, a simple Expo/React Native frontend and Node.js backend with dummy data were established. Key challenges involved  compatibility, leading to a temporary shift to a list-based UI for shops. The user then provided extensive new requirements, necessitating a major restructure to accommodate User, Member, and Merchant flows. The AI engineer adapted by implementing new dashboards, registration forms with validations, and a comprehensive member flow, including search, categories, shop details, and mock payment. The current phase is focused on resolving a persistent logout functionality issue across dashboards, demonstrating iterative problem-solving and responsiveness to user feedback.

    *   Savings Calculator: Estimated Monthly Spend, Monthly Savings, Annual Savings.
    *   Member/Merchant Tabs:
        *   **Member Tab:** Shows IT Max and IT Max Plus plans. Tapping a plan leads to **Member Registration Form**: Contact Name, Customer Location (full-screen map picker), Email, Phone Number, Pincode, Multi Image Uploader, Terms & Conditions. API call () on registration (mocked success). Redirect to Member Dashboard.
        *   **Merchant Tab:** Leads to **Merchant Registration Form**: Business Name, Contact Name, Business Category, Description, Years in Business, Branches, Email, Phone Number, Pincode, Business Location (full-screen map picker), Address, Introduced By, Multi Image Uploader, Terms & Conditions. API call () on registration (mocked success). Redirect to Merchant Dashboard.
    *   Nearby Shops Section: Scrollable list with image, name, category, distance (auto-scrolling infinite loop added).
    *   Footer: Shop Local, Save Instantly! statement.
2.  **Member Flow (after registration):**

    *   **Merchant Dashboard:** Logo, merchant profile (merchant dropdown with account, merchant, logout). Full details of merchant shop with images, names, ratings, total payments list (customer amount, discount, total received, payment completed button).

All new API calls for registration are to be considered successful for now. Maps API key  is provided. Image uploads should be base64.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** Expo, React Native,  (file-based routing), React Navigation, Zustand (state management), AsyncStorage, ,  (with  compatibility challenges),  (for auto-scrolling).
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (for mock APIs), FastAPI (for new APIs).
- **Data:** In-memory dummy data (JSON).
- **Other:** Google Maps API, Base64 encoding for images, Git/GitLab for version control.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with a  (FastAPI/Node.js) and  (Expo/React Native) directory.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on fixing the logout functionality. The user reported that for merchant logout is not working properly ..please update when logout clicked user or merchant has to logged out and come to mobile number screen (Chat Message 353 and 359). The AI engineer identified that  might not be completely cleared upon logout and attempted to update  to ensure proper session clearing and redirection. The previous attempt involved modifying the  function within the  to clear  and reset the user state. This is an ongoing debugging effort to ensure both member and merchant flows correctly log out and navigate back to the initial mobile number entry screen.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue debugging and fixing the logout functionality in  and related dashboard components.
