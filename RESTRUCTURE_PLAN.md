## Estimated Development Time

- **Phase 1 (Registration)**: 8-10 hours
- **Phase 2 (Member Flow)**: 10-12 hours
- **Phase 3 (Merchant Flow)**: 6-8 hours
- **Phase 4 (Polish)**: 4-6 hours

**Total**: 28-36 hours of development

---

## Notes

1. **Map Integration**: react-native-maps needs custom dev client for Expo SDK 54. Consider using Expo's built-in map or web-based fallback.

2. **Image Upload**: Need to convert images to base64 or upload to cloud storage before sending to API.

3. **Payment Integration**: Currently mocked. Real integration needs:
   - PhonePe SDK
   - Google Pay integration
   - Paytm SDK
   - Or unified payment gateway

4. **Form Validations**: Use `react-hook-form` + `zod` for better form handling.

5. **Testing**: Each flow needs thorough testing before integration.

---

## Next Steps for Developer

1. Start with Phase 1 - Core Registration
2. Create registration forms first (most critical)
3. Implement map picker component
4. Test registration with mock APIs
5. Move to Member Dashboard once registration works
6. Then implement Merchant Dashboard
7. Polish and add remaining features

**This is a significant restructuring project. The current code provides a good foundation, but major work is needed to match your specification exactly.**
